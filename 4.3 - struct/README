NOTA BENE:
those having troubles in compiling the source due to how the c for statement is written 

"for(int i .....)"

should try to change the CC definition in the make file to be like the following:

CC = gcc -std=c99


ANOTHER NOTE:

This is an example on how to NOT write C code.
This example contains some (a lot) of memory leaks. I didn't have enougth time to rewrite the code or check for memory leaks, eventhough they may be spotted easly to a trained eye.
